<h2 align="justify">1. Introduction</h2>

<p align="justify">
       Rogue  is  a  screen-oriented  fantasy  game set in the
       ever-changing Dungeons of Doom.   The  game  comes  complete
       with  monsters,  spells,  weapons, armor, potions, and other
       magical items.  The dungeon's geography changes  with  every
       game,   and   although   many  magical  items  have  certain
       identifiable  properties,  such  as   turning   the   player
       invisible,  the  physical manifestation of the magic changes
       each game.  A red potion, for example, will cause  the  same
       reaction throughout a given game, but it may be a completely
       different potion in a new game.
</p>

<p align=justify>
       Entering the dungeon with only a  little  food,  armor,
       and  a  weapon,  the  player must develop a good strategy of
       when to fight, when to run, and how to best use any  magical
       items found in the dungeon.  To make things interesting, the
       player  has  a  quest  to  return  one  of  several   unique
       artifacts,  rumored  to  lie  deep  in the dungeon's bowels.
       Returning with this artifact  brings  great  glory  and  the
       title  of  Complete  Winner.   But  even  after  finding the
       artifact, the player may wish to continue further  to  match
       wits with an arch-devil, demon prince, or even a deity found
       far down in the dungeon.  Defeating  such  a  creature  will
       gain  the  player  many  experience  points,  the  basis for
       scoring in Rogue.
</p>

<p align=justify>
       It is very difficult to return  from  the  Dungeons  of
       Doom.   Few  people  ever  make  it  out alive.  Should this
       unlikely event occur,  the  player  would  be  proclaimed  a
       complete  winner  and  handsomely  rewarded  for  any  booty
       removed from the dungeon.
</p>

<h3 align="justify">2. Character Classes</h3>

<p align="justify">
       Before placing the player  in  the  dungeon,  the  game
       requests  the  player  to select what type of character they
       would like to be:  a fighter, a  magic  user,  a  cleric,  a
       druid, a thief, a paladin, a ranger, a monk, or an assassin.
</p>

<p align="justify"><span style="font-variant: small-caps"><strong>2.1 The Fighter</strong></span></p>

<p align="justify">
       A fighter is very strong and will have a high  strength
       rating.   This  great strength gives a fighter the best odds
       of winning a battle with  a  monster.   At  high  experience
       levels  the  fighter also gets to attack multiple times in a
       single turn.  This obviously further increases  his  chances
       at  winning  battles.   Intrinsic  to the fighter class is a
       robustness which results in 1 to 12  extra  hit  points  for
       every new experience level.
</p>

<p align="justify"><span style="font-variant: small-caps"><strong>2.2 The Magician</strong></span></p>

<p align="justify">
       A  Magician  is  able to "cast" spells.  The number and
       variety of spells increases as the magician gains experience
       and   intelligence.   Magic  users  are  not  as  hearty  as
       fighters; they receive 1 to 6 extra hit points for every new
       experience level.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong><span style="font-variant: small-caps">2.3 The Cleric</span></strong></p>

<p align="justify">
       A  cleric  is  able to "pray" to his god for help.  The
       number and variety of prayers which the gods are willing  to
       grant  to  a  cleric increase as the cleric gains experience
       and wisdom.
       </p>
       
<p align=justify>
       Because of their religious  nature,  clerics  can  also
       affect  the  "undead" beings, like zombies and ghouls, which
       became monsters after they died.  If an "undead" creature is
       next to a cleric, the cleric may try to turn it and cause it
       to flee.  If the cleric is sufficiently powerful relative to
       the  monster,  the  cleric  will  destroy  it.  This ability
       increases as the character gains experience levels.
</p>

<p align=justify>
       Clerics can gain from  1  to  8  extra  hit  points  on
       reaching a new experience level.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong><span style="font-variant: small-caps">2.4 The Druid</span></strong></p>

<p align="justify"> 
       The  druid  is  a  cleric  of sorts but worships nature
       rather than a god.  The druid is able to "chant" and thereby
       recieve  certain  types  of  spells.  Most of the chants are
       targeted more towards the elements and nature.
</p>

<p align=justify>            
       Druids gain from 1 to 8 hit points when  they  gain  an
       experience level.
</p>
       
<p align="justify"><strong><span style="font-variant: small-caps">2.5 The Thief</span></strong></p>

<p align="justify">
       A thief is exceptionally dextrous and has a good chance
       to set a trap or rob a monster.
</p>

<p align=justify>
       By their nature, thieves can automatically  detect  all
       the gold on the current level of the dungeon.  They are also
       good at  detecting  hidden  traps.   Because  thieves  slink
       along,  they  are  not as likely as other characters to wake
       sleeping monsters.  If a thief manages  to  sneak  up  on  a
       creature without waking it, he will get a chance to backstab
       the monster. When this is done, the damage done by the thief
       greatly increases based on his experience level.
</p>

<p align=justify>
       Thieves  gain  from  1 to 6 extra hit points from a new
       experience level.
</p>

<p align="justify"><strong><span style="font-variant: small-caps">2.6 The Paladin</span></strong></p>

<p align="justify">
       The paladin is a type of holy warrior.  Somewhat  of  a
       cross between a fighter and a cleric. He is able to pray and
       turn undead as a cleric, (but to a lesser degree) but fights
       as  a  fighter.  He  is  on the side of all that is good and
       righteous. Therefore he would never attack a  creature  that
       would  not  attack  him first. If he does kill a non-violent
       creature inadvertantly he will feel "uneasy" and his god may
       retaliate by making him a mere fighter.
</p>

<p align=justify>
            Paladins  gain 1 to 10 hit points per experience level.
</p>

<p align="justify"><strong><span style="font-variant: small-caps">2.7 The Ranger</span></strong></p>

<p align="justify">
       The ranger is somewhat of a cross between a druid and a
       fighter.  He  too  is on the side of righteousness and good.
       Therefore, the same same restrictions apply to his  as  they
       do  to a paladin. The ranger can "chant" and "cast" but to a
       lesser degree than the druid and magician.
</p>

<p align=justify>
       Rangers gain 1 to 8 hit points per experience level.
</p>

<p align="justify"><strong><span style="font-variant: small-caps">2.8 The Monk</span></strong></p>

<p align="justify">
       The Monk is a martial arts expert. He  wears  no  armor
       but  has  an  effective  armor class based on his ability to
       dodge attacks.  He does not need a weapon in combat for  his
       hands and feet are a formidable weapon. His ability to dodge
       and use his hands as weapons increases as he gains in level.
</p>

<p align=justify>
       Monks gain 1 to 6 hit points per experience level.
</p>

<p align="justify"><strong><span style="font-variant: small-caps">2.9 The Assassin</span></strong></p>

<p align="justify">
       The  assassin is a person trained in the art of killing
       people by surprise. He has most  of  the  abilities  of  the
       thief  except  the "backstab". Instead, the assassin has the
       chance to kill an opponent outright with one strike.  He  is
       also  a ruthless character and trained in the use of poison.
       He can recognize poison on sight and  can  coat  his  weapon
       with  it  thereby  making  his  next attack an exceptionally
       lethal one.
</p>

<p align=justify>
       Assassins gain 1 to 6 hit points per experience  level.
</p>

<h3 align="justify">3. ATTRIBUTES</h3>

<p align="justify"><strong><span style="font-variant: small-caps">3.1 Intelligence</span></strong></p>

<p align="justify">Intelligence  is  the primary attribute associated with
       casting spells. With higher intelligence comes the knowledge
       of  more spells, the ability to cast more spells, and faster
       recovery of spells that have been cast.

</p>

<p align="justify"><strong><span style="font-variant: small-caps">3.2 Strength</span></strong></p>
<p align="justify">This is,  of  course,  the  measure  of  a  character's
       physical  strength.   With  higher  strength a character can
       carry more, cause more damage when striking, have  a  better
       chance  to  strike  an opponent, and move about more quickly
       when carrying a load.

       </p>
<p align="justify"><strong><span style="font-variant: small-caps">3.3 Wisdom</span></strong></p>
<p align="justify">Wisdom is the primary attribute associated with Praying
       to  a  god.  With  higher wisdom comes the knowledge of more
       prayers, the ability to pray more often, and faster recovery
       of prayer ability.

       </p>
<p align="justify"><strong><span style="font-variant: small-caps">3.4 Dexterity</span></strong></p>
<p align="justify">Dexterity  is  a measure of a character's agility. With
       higher dexterity a character is harder to  hit,  can  hit  a
       opponent  more  easily, and can move about more quickly when
       carrying a load.

       </p>
<p align="justify"><strong><span style="font-variant: small-caps">3.5 Constitution</span></strong></p>
<p align="justify">Every character has a constitution rating.  A character
       with  an exceptionally good constitution will gain more than
       the  normal  amount  of  hit  points  associated  with   the
       character's   class   when   the  character  reaches  a  new
       experience level.  Exceptional  constitution  also  provides
       better  protection versus poison-based attacks and diseases.

       </p>
<p align="justify"><strong><span style="font-variant: small-caps">3.6 Charisma</span></strong></p>
<p align="justify">Charisma is a measure of a characters looks and general
       likeableness.    It  effects  transactions  when  trying  to
       purchase things. </p>

<p align="justify"><strong><span style="font-variant: small-caps">3.7 Experience Levels</span></strong></p>

<p align="justify">
Characters  gain  experience  for   killing   monsters,
stealing   from   monsters,   and  turning  monsters.   Each
character class has a set of thresholds associated with  it.
When  a character reaches a threshold, the character attains
the next experience level.  This new level brings extra  hit
points  and  a  greater  chance of success in performing the
abilities  associated  with  the  character's  class.    For
example,  magicians  receive new spells, and clerics receive
new prayers.
</p>

<p align="justify">

<strong><span style="font-variant: small-caps">3.8 Allocating Attributes</span></strong>
</p>
<p align="justify">
The player starts with 72 "attribute points" to  create
a  character and can distribute them in any manner among the
six attributes described above.  When prompting  the  player
for  each  attribute,  the  game  displays  the  minimum and
maximum allowable values for that attribute.  The player can
type  a backspace (control-H) to go back and change a value;
typing an escape (ESC) sets the remaining attributes to  the
maximum value possible given the remaining attribute points.
</p>

<h3 align="justify">
4.0
THE SCREEN</h3>
<p align="justify">
During the normal course of play, the  screen  consists
of  three  separate sections:  the top line of the terminal,
the bottom two lines of  the  terminal,  and  the  remaining
middle  lines.   The  top  line  reports actions which occur
during the game, the middle section depicts the dungeon, and
the bottom lines describe the player's current condition.
</p>

<p align="justify"><strong><span style="font-variant: small-caps">4.1 The Top Line</span></strong>

<p align="justify">
Whenever  anything  happens  to  the  player,  such  as
finding a scroll or hitting or being hit  by  a  monster,  a
short  report  of  the occurrence appears on the top line of
the screen.  When such  reports  occur  quickly,  one  right
after  another, the game displays the notice followed by the
prompt '--More--.'  After reading this  notice,  the  player
can  press  a  space to display the next message.  At such a
point, the  game  ignores  all  commands  until  the  player
presses a space.
</p> 
      
<p align="justify">
<strong><span style="font-variant: small-caps">4.2 The Dungeon Section</span></strong><p align="justify">
The  large  middle  section  of the screen displays the
player's surroundings using the following symbols:

</p>

<p align="justify"><strong><span style="font-variant: small-caps">4.3 The Status Section</span></strong></p>

<p align="justify">
The  bottom  two  lines  of  the  screen  describe  the
player's current status.  The first line gives the  player's
characteristics:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p align="justify">Intelligence (Int)</li>
<li>
<p align="justify">Strength (Str)</li>
<li>
<p align="justify">Wisdom (Wis)</li>
<li>
<p align="justify">Dexterity (Dxt)</li>
<li>
<p align="justify">Constitution (Const)</li>
<li>
<p align="justify">Charisma (Char)</li>
<li>
<p align="justify">Encumberance (Carry)</li>
</ul>

<p align=justify>
Intelligence,  strength,  wisdom,  dexterity, charisma,
and constitution have a normal maximum of  25,  but  can  be
higher   when  augmented  by  a  ring.   Encumberance  is  a
measurement of how much the player can carry versus how much
he  is  currently  carrying.  The more you carry relative to
your maximum causes you to use more food.
</p>

<p align=justify>
The  second  status   line   provides   the   following
information:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p align="justify">The  current  level  (Lvl) in the dungeon.  This number
increases as the player goes further down.
</li>
<li>
<p align="justify">The  player's  current  number  of  hit  points   (Hp),
followed in parentheses by the player's current maximum
number of hit points.  Hit points express the  player's
health.   As  a  player  heals by resting, the player's
current hit points gradually  increase  until  reaching
the  current maximum.  This maximum increases each time
a player  attains  a  new  experience  level.   If  the
player's current hit points reach 0, the player dies.
</li>
<li>
<p align="justify">The  player's  armor class (Ac).  This number describes
the amount of protection provided by the armor, cloaks,
and/or  rings currently worn by the player.  It is also
affected by high or low dexterity.  Wearing no armor is
equivalent  to  an  armor  class of 10.  The protection
level increases as the armor class decreases.
</li>
<li>
<p align="justify">The player's current experience level (Exp) followed by
the  player's  experience  points.  The player can gain
experience points  by  killing  monsters,  successfully
stealing  from  monsters, and turning monsters.  When a
player gains enough  experience  points  to  surpass  a
threshold  that depends on the player's character type,
the player reaches  a  new  experience  level.   A  new
experience  level  brings extra hit points and possibly
added abilities, such as a new spell for a magician  or
a new prayer for a cleric.
</li>
<li>
<p align="justify">A   description   of   the  player's  character.   This
description depends on the player's character type  and
experience level.
</li>
</ul>

<h3 align="justify">5.0 COMMANDS</h3>

<p align="justify">     
A  player  can  invoke  most Rogue commands by typing a
single  character.   Some  commands,  however,   require   a
direction,  in  which  case  the  player  types  the command
character followed by a directional command.  Many  commands
can  be  prefaced by a number, indicating how many times the
command should be executed.
</p>

<p align=justify>
When the player invokes a command referring to an  item
in  the  player's  pack (such as reading a scroll), the game
prompts for the item.   The  player  should  then  type  the
letter  associated  with  the  item,  as  displayed  by  the
inventory command.  Typing a '*' at this  point  produces  a
list of the eligible items.
</p>

</p>

<h3 align="justify">6. IMPLICIT COMMANDS</h3>

<p align="justify">
There  is  no  "attack" command.  If a player wishes to
attack a monster, the player simply tries to move  onto  the
spot  where  the monster is standing.  The game then assumes
that the player wishes to attack the monster  with  whatever
weapon the player is wielding.
</p>

<p align=justify>
When   the   player   moves  onto  an  item,  the  game
automatically places the object into the player's pack.   If
there  is  no room left in the pack, the game announces that
fact and leaves the item on the floor.
</p>

<h3 align="justify">7. TIME</h3>

<p align="justify">
All actions except  for  purely  bookkeeping  commands,
such  as taking an inventory, take time.  The amount of time
varies with the command.  Swinging a  weapon,  for  example,
takes  more time than simply moving; so a monster could move
several spaces in the time it takes the player to  make  one
attack.   The  time  it  takes to swing a weapon also varies
based on the bulk of the weapon, and the time  it  takes  to
simply  move  a  space  varies  with the type of armor worn.
Movement is always faster when flying.
</p>

<p align=justify>
Since actions take time, some of them can be disrupted.
If  the player is casting a spell, for example, and gets hit
before finishing it, the  spell  is  lost.   Similarly,  the
player  might  choke if hit while trying to eat.  Of course,
the same rule applies when the player hits a monster.
</p>

<p align=justify>
Magical  hasting  (or  slowing)   will   decrease   (or
increase) the time it takes to perform an action.
</p>

<h3 align="justify">8.0 LIGHT</h3>

<p align="justify">
Some  rooms  in  the  dungeon  possess  a natural light
source.  In other rooms and in corridors the player can  see
only those things within a one space radius from the player.
These dark rooms can be lit with magical light or by a  fire
beetle.
</p>

<h3 align="justify">9. WEAPONS AND ARMOR</h3>

<p align="justify">
The  player  can  wield  exactly  one weapon at a time.
When the player attacks a  monster,  the  amount  of  damage
depends on the particular weapon the player is wielding.  To
fire a projectile weapon, such as a crossbow or a short bow,
the  player  should  wield  the  bow and "throw" the bolt or
arrow at the monster.
</p>

<p align=justify>
A weapon  may  be  cursed  or  blessed,  affecting  the
likelihood  of  hitting  a  monster  with the weapon and the
damage the weapon will  inflict  on  the  monster.   If  the
player has identified a weapon, the "to hit" and "to damage"
bonuses appear in that order before the weapon's name in  an
inventory  listing.   A  positive  bonus indicates a blessed
weapon, and a negative  bonus  usually  indicates  a  cursed
weapon.  The player cannot release a cursed weapon.
</p>

<p align=justify>
Without  any armor the player has an armor class of 10.
The lower the player's armor class, the harder it is  for  a
monster  to hit the player, so wearing armor can improve the
player's armor class.  A  cursed  suit  of  armor,  however,
offers  poor  protection  and may sometimes be worse than no
armor at all.
</p>

<p align=justify>
After the player has identified a suit  of  armor,  the
protection  bonus  appears  before  the  armor's  name in an
inventory listing.  If the bonus is positive  the  armor  is
blessed, and if it is negative, the armor is usually cursed.
The player cannot remove a cursed suit of armor.
</p>

<p align=justify>
Some monsters can corrode armor when they hit  it.   If
such  a  monster  hits the player when the player is wearing
metal armor, the armor loses some of its  protection  value,
but  the corrosion does not curse the armor.  This corrosive
property can also apply to weapons when the player hits such
a monster.
</p>


<h3 align="justify">10. POTIONS AND SCROLLS</h3>

<p align="justify">
The  player  can frequently find potions and scrolls in
the  dungeon.   In  any  given  dungeon,  the   player   can
distinguish  among  the  different  types  of  potions  by a
potion's color and among the different types of scrolls by a
scroll's  name.   Quaffing  a  potion  or  reading  a scroll
usually causes some magical occurrence.   Most  potions  and
scrolls may be cursed or blessed.
</p>

<h3 align="justify">11. RINGS</h3>

<p align="justify">
The  player can wear a maximum of eight rings, and they
have a magical effect on the player  as  long  as  they  are
worn.   Some  rings  also  speed up the player's metabolism,
making the player require food more often.  Many  rings  can
be  cursed or blessed, and the player cannot remove a cursed
ring.  The player can distinguish among different  types  of
rings by a ring's jewel.
</p>

<h3 align="justify">12. WANDS AND STAVES</h3>

<p align="justify">
Wands  and staves affect the player's environment.  The
player can zap a wand or  staff  at  something  and  perhaps
shoot  a  bolt  of lightning at it or teleport it away.  All
wands or staves of the same type are  constructed  with  the
same  type  of wood.  Some wands and staves may be cursed or
blessed.
</p>

<h3 align="justify">13.  FOOD</h3>

<p align=justify>
The player must be careful not to run out of food since
moving  through the dungeon fighting monsters consumes a lot
of energy.  Starving results in the  player's  fainting  for
increasingly longer periods of time, during which any nearby
monster can attack the player freely.
</p>

<p align=justify>
Food comes in the form of standard  rations  and  as  a
variety  of  berries.   Some  berries  have  side effects in
addition to satisfying one's hunger.
</p>

<h3 align="justify">14.  GOLD</h3>

<p align=justify>
Gold has one use in a dungeon:  buying things.  One can
buy  things  in two ways, either in a trading post or from a
quartermaster.  A trading post is  a  place  that  sometimes
occurs "between levels" of the dungeon and can be entered by
stepping on the entrance.  A quartermaster is a  person  who
will  sometimes  appear and will try to sell the player some
of his wares.  These wares are never cursed  and  frequently
blessed,  though  blessed goods cost more than normal goods.
If the player chooses to  buy  one  of  the  quartermaster's
items,  the  quartermaster trades the item for the specified
amount of gold and disappears.   Attacking  a  quartermaster
causes him to vanish without offering a trade.
</p>

<p align=justify>
The  player  starts  the  game in a trading post with a
class-dependent  allotment  of  gold.   Although  there  are
restrictions  on  the  use of some items (eg. only fighters,
paladins, and rangers  can  wield  two-handed  swords),  the
market  will  happily  sell  the player anything that he can
afford.
</p>

<h3 align="justify">15.  MISCELLANEOUS MAGIC ITEMS</h3>

<p align=justify>
Miscellaneous items such as a pair of boots or  a  book
may be found within the dungeon.  These items can usually be
used to  the  player's  advantage  (assuming  they  are  not
cursed).   Some of these items can be worn, such as a cloak,
while others are to be used, such as a book.
</p>

<h3 align="justify">16.  ARTIFACTS</h3>

<p align=justify>
Some monsters down in the depths of the  dungeon  carry
unique  artifacts.   The  game begins as a quest to retrieve
one of these items.   Each  artifact  appears  only  on  its
owner's person.  These items also can usually be used to the
player's  advantage.  However,  care  must  be  taken   when
handling  them  for  they  are  intelligent  and will reject
mishandling or abuse. These items consume  food  and  merely
carrying them will result in increased food use.
</p>

<h3 align="justify">17.  TRAPS</h3>

<p align=justify>
A  variety  of traps, including trap doors, bear traps,
and sleeping traps, are hidden in the dungeon.  They  remain
hidden  until  sprung  by a monster or the player.  A sprung
trap continues to function, but  since  it  is  visible,  an
intelligent monster is not likely to tread on it.
</p>

<h3 align="justify">18.  THE MONSTERS</h3>

<p align=justify>
Each  monster  except  for  the  merchant quartermaster
appears in a limited range of dungeon levels.  All  monsters
of  the  same type share the same abilities; all giant rats,
for  example,  can  give  the  player  a  disease,  and  all
jackalweres  can  put  the player to sleep.  Monsters of the
same type can vary, however, such that  one  kobold  may  be
much  more  difficult to kill than another one.  In general,
the more difficult  it  is  to  kill  a  monster,  the  more
experience points the monster is worth.
</p>

<p align=justify>
Most  monsters  attack  by biting and clawing, but some
monsters carry weapons, including such projectile weapons as
short  bows  and  crossbows,  and  some monsters have breath
weapons.  Some monsters even  use  magical  items,  such  as
wands.   Monsters  with distance weapons or magic can attack
the player from across a room or down a corridor.
</p>

<p align=justify>
Some monsters are more intelligent than others, and the
more intelligent a monster, the more likely that the monster
will run away if it is about to die.  A fleeing monster will
not attack the player unless cornered.
</p>

<p align=justify>
It  is  sometimes  possible  to enlist a monster's aid.
Reading a charm monster scroll, for example,  or  singing  a
charm monster chant can make a monster believe the player is
its friend.  A charmed monster will fight  hostile  monsters
for the player as long as they are not of its race.
</p>

<p align=justify>
As  the  player moves down in the dungeon, the monsters
get more powerful.  Deep down in  the  dungeon  there  exist
some  one-of-a-kind  monsters.   These  monsters are greatly
feared.  However, once a "unique  monster"  is  killed,  the
player will not find another in the current dungeon. 
</p>


<h3 align="justify">19. OPTIONS</h3>

<p align="justify">
Rogue has several options which may be set by the player:
</p>

<p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="3" style="border-collapse: collapse" id="table5" cellspacing="3">
	<tr>
		<td valign="top">terse</td>
		<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
		<td>Setting this Boolean option results in shorter messages appearing on 
		the top line of the screen.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top">jump</td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td>Setting this Boolean option results in waiting until the player has 
		finished running to draw the player's path. Otherwise the game always 
		displays the path one step at a time.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top">step</td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td>Setting this Boolean option results in most listings, such as an 
		inventory, appearing one item at a time on the top line of the screen. 
		When this option is not set, the game clears the screen, displays the 
		list, and then redraws the dungeon.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top">flush</td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td>Setting this Boolean option results in flushing all typeahead 
		(pending) commands when the player encounters a monster.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top">askme</td>
		<td nowrap>&nbsp;</td>
		<td>Setting this Boolean option results in the game prompting the 
		player for a name upon encountering a
		new type of scroll, potion, ring, staff, or wand.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top">pickup</td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td>This option specifies whether items should be picked up automatically 
		as the rogue steps over them. In the non-automatic mode, the player may 
		still pick up items via the pickup (P) command. The option defaults to 
		true.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top">name</td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td>This string is the player's name and defaults to the player's 
		account name.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top">file</td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td>This string, which defaults to arogue77.sav, specifies the file to 
		use for saving the game.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top">score</td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td>This string identifies the top-twenty score file to use for the 
		game.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top">class</td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td>This option specifies the character class of the rogue. It can be 
		set only in the ROGUEOPTS<br>
		environment variable.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td nowrap valign="top">quested item</td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td>This option is set by the game at the start and cannot be reset by 
		the player. It is merely listed<br>
		to remind the player of his quest.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
</p>

<p align="justify">
The player can set options at the beginning of a game via the 
ROGUEOPTS environment variable. Naming a Boolean option sets it, and preceding 
the Boolean option name by &quot;no&quot; clears it. The syntax &quot;stringoption=name&quot; sets a 
string option to &quot;name.&quot; So setting ROGUEOPTS to &quot;terse, jump, nostep, flush, 
askme, name=Ivan the Terrible&quot; would set the terse, jump, flush, and askme 
Boolean options, clear the step Boolean option, set the player's name to &quot;Ivan 
the Terrible,&quot; and use the defaults for the save file and the score file.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The player may change an option at any time during the game via the option 
command, which results in a listing of the current options. Typing a new value 
changes the option, a RETURN moves to the next option, a '-' moves to the 
previous option, and an ESCAPE returns the player to the dungeon.
</p>

<h3 align="justify">20. SCORING</h3>

<p align="justify">
The player receives experience points for stealing items from monsters, 
turning monsters (a clerical ability),
and killing monsters. When the player gets killed, the player's score equals the 
player's experience points. A
player who quits gets a score equal to the player's experience points and gold. 
If the player makes it back up
out of the dungeon, the player's score equals the player's experience points 
plus the gold the player carried and the gold received from selling the player's 
possessions.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Rogue maintains a list of the top twenty scores to date, together with the name 
of the player obtaining the score, the level where the player finished, and the manner in which the player 
ended the game. As an installation option, the game may record only one entry per character type and login; this 
restriction encourages a greater number of different players in the scorechart.
</p>

<h3 align="justify">21. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h3>
